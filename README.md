#  Bitcoin Ticker

## Our Goal

The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills you learned in the Clima tutorial and make a Bitcoin price reporter. We are going to revisit how to use Cocoapods, networking calls and JSON parsing. This will be the most advanced challenge you will face to date. We believe in you!

## What you will create

We’re going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.
